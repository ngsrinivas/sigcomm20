            "abstract" : "Data-driven generative data models produce random samples from a target distribution (e.g. autoregressive models, Gaussian mixtures, etc.). Despite decades of study in multiple communities, generative models have historically struggled to capture the complex correlations found in most real data. However, recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to a significant jump in their performance, albeit mostly in the image and video domains. In this talk, we give a primer on state-of-the-art deep generative models, and discuss three use cases where the networking community may be able to benefit from these tools: (1) synthetic data generation, (2) vulnerability testing of black-box protocols and systems, and (3) extracting qualitative insights from unstructured data. We will discuss results in each of these application domains, highlight challenges and tradeoffs, and conclude with some open questions.",
