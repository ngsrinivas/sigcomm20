          <h1>Camera-Ready Instructions</h1>
          
<p>Authors of conditionally accepted papers have been notified. They should work with their shepherds to address the reviewers&rsquo; concerns. All papers will require the explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd. Authors of papers with artifacts can also opt-in for <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">artifact evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>Authors should upload camera-ready versions of their papers to
  HotCRP. Shepherds should indicate when a paper is complete by e-mail
  to the authors and TPC chairs. <strong>Final camera-ready papers are due in HotCRP (approved by the shepherd) by </strong><strong>July 3, 2020 23:59 UTC.</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions about the camera-ready process, please
  contact the SIGCOMM 2020 publication chairs <strong><a href="mailto:apanda@cs.nyu.edu,mt822@cornell.edu?subject=[SIGCOMM 2020]">Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo and Aurojit Panda.</a></strong></p>
<h3>Paper Formatting</h3>
<p>All papers must obey the following formatting requirements to be included in the proceedings. As such, we strongly encourage you to thoroughly review their final submissions to ensure that they include all the mandatory sections and statements and comply with all the listed requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abstract. </strong>You must provide an abstract, and it should be no more than 200 words.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>CCS Concepts. </strong>Final papers must provide proper indexing information according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS and how to obtain them is available on <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012"><strong>ACM CCS website</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keywords. </strong>Final papers must include a list of keywords that best describe the topic of the paper.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACM Reference Format. </strong>Final papers must include the ACM reference format of the paper. If using the provided template, this is typically automatically generated from the paper&rsquo;s title and list of authors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>CopyRights Statement. </strong>In its bottom-left corner, the first page of the final paper must include a copyright notice that you will receive after filling out the e-Rights form via the ACM rights-management tool on the HotCRP page of the paper. ACM will use its automated system to email this information to the authors. Please set your email spam settings to allow messages from "rightsreview@acm.org". The copyright block includes the DOI specific to the paper, rights-management text that depends on the author's choice of a license or copyright transfer, the official name, dates, and location of the event.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Paper Body. </strong>The paper body is all the content before reference and appendices.&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Paper bodies must be no more than twelve (12) single-spaced pages, including figures and tables.</li>
<li>Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5&Prime; by 11&Prime;) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25&Prime; by 3.33&Prime;, 0.33&Prime; space between columns. Each column must use the 9-point font (different from the submission), and contain no more than 56 lines of text.</li>
<li><strong>You must not number the pages.</strong></li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Ethics Statement. </strong>The paper body <strong>must</strong> include some statement about ethical considerations. This could be simply the sentence "This work does not raise any ethical issues", or for a paper involving human subjects, the discussion may be more detailed.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>References. </strong>There are no page limits on references. References should include the full first and last names of all authors. Avoid using only the initials for the first names. Also, avoid eliding author names with &ldquo;et. al.&rdquo;. Moreover, please make sure the internal references or citations are not broken (showing up as "[?]" or "??"). Take extra care for references with a diacritic or non-ASCII character to avoid garbled text.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Appendices (Optional). </strong>Appendices may supplement the paper, but cannot be essential to the paper's central results. (For example, if the appendix provides details of a proof or experiment, the body should summarize the key result.) <strong>Before the first appendix, the following text should appear: "Appendices are supporting material that has not been peer-reviewed." </strong>Appendices are optional and have no page limits.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fonts. </strong>Please make sure all fonts are embedded in the document. On Mac, Windows, and Linux, the 'pdffonts' (Poppler) and Adobe Reader tools can report this information. For more information, please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/614619/how-to-find-out-which-fonts-are-referenced-and-which-are-embedded-in-a-pdf-docum"><strong>this Stack Overflow page</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Legibility. </strong>You should ensure that the paper prints well on black-and-white printers, not color printers. Pay particular attention to figures and graphs in the paper to ensure that they are legible without color. Explicitly using grayscale colors will provide the best control over how graphs and figures will print on black-and-white printers. You should also ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.</li>
<li><strong>File Size. </strong>You should limit the file size to less than 15 MB. Contact the publication chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB.</li>
<li><strong>Links. </strong>Please avoid using link shorteners (e.g., bit.ly and tinyurl) in URLs, and ensure all hyperlinks to the right URL.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source Files. </strong>Alongside the camera-ready PDF, you are required to submit the source files for your paper &ndash; all files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files, etc.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Latex/Word Templates. </strong>We strongly encourage you to
  use ACM&rsquo;s set of TeX and MS-Word templates for conference
  proceedings <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>
  (the sigconf template). You <strong>must add "9pt" to the
    documentclass command</strong> to meet the submission
  requirements. It will read:
  \documentclass[sigconf,9pt]{acmart}. Note that ACM offers 24/7
  author support for these templates through their vendor, Aptara. You
  can contact them
  at <a href="mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com">acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com</a>
  for TeX/MS-Word template problems or inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>Format Checker Tool. </strong>You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate <a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sigops/banal/index.php"><strong>online form</strong></a>. We will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. Since the format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes, the publication chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject papers with format violations.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications to title and authors. </strong>After acceptance, substantive changes to paper titles require approval by the PC chairs. Only in exceptional circumstances should authors change their author list, and only with the approval of the PC chairs.</p>
<h3>Open Access</h3>
<p>While the ACM rights-management tool offers the author to pay for open access to the published paper, SIGCOMM has already arranged free access to all SIGCOMM 2020 papers via non-expiring links to the ACM Digital Library (DL) on the SIGCOMM 2020 website. This is a special form of open access, which the ACM calls the OpenTOC service. Unless the author wants to provide the open access to the paper directly at the ACM DL rather than via the special SIGCOMM 2020 website link, we suggest that the author opts for not paying the open access fee in the ACM rights management tool.</p>
<h3>Artifact Evaluation</h3>
<p>Authors should have received instructions on how to opt-in for the artifact evaluation process. The artifacts will be evaluated by a committee, and the papers that pass the evaluation will receive appropriate badges. You can find more information about what is considered an artifact and different ACM badges for artifact evaluation <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">here</a>.</p>
<p>Artifacts must remain available for several years. You can either make them available through the ACM Digital Library or by providing a stable URL in your camera-ready paper:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACM Digital Library. </strong>You can submit your artifacts that are within the specified size limits to HotCRP as &ldquo;Auxiliary Materials&rdquo;. This could be a good option, for example, for a data set that will not change. ACM will not take copyright to Auxiliary Material as they are not part of the formally published work. But ACM can serve them on the ACM Digital Library with permission from the owner. This can be done by checking Part II of the e-Rights form and accepting the terms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stable Link.</strong> You can provide a URL to the artifacts in the paper. This could be a good option, for example, for source code. You must provide a stable URL, e.g., from your institution, GitHub, or better a DOI from providers like Zenodo. URLs to personal web pages are not acceptable.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
