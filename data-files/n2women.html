<p><b>Due to the still significant statutory travel restrictions and
  coronavirus outbreak, it is the first &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; N2Women
  workshop, which will be co-hosted on the same virtual platform as
  SIGCOMM&rsquo;20.</b></p>

<p>The N2Women workshop aims to foster connections among the
under-represented women in computer networking and related research
fields. The 10th N2Women Workshop also welcomes <em>men</em> who share
the same research interests, attend the same conferences, and often
face the same career hurdles and obstacles to join us!</p>

<p>The N2Women workshop has three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect newer generations of networking women researchers with the community and create mentorship relationships;</li>
<li>Create a research forum in which students and junior researchers learn and discuss current trends in networking, present their research and receive feedback;</li>
<li>Engage a diverse body of junior researchers in the field.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="whats-new">What&rsquo;s new this year</h3>

<li>Best poster award, and &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; for best poster and runners-up</li>
<li>E-travel grant of FREE SIGCOMM&rsquo;20 registration for one author per accepted poster</li>

<p>You are also welcome to attend mentoring sessions organized by SIGCOMM&rsquo;20 throughout the SIGCOMM week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are looking for mentors who can host mentees with similar research interests during N2Womean and the main SIGCOMM conference and workshops. If you are a SIGCOMM regular attendee and a senior researcher, please consider volunteering as a mentor. If you are interested in helping out, please email N2Women&rsquo;20 workshop co-chairs or the mentor chair of SIGCOMM&rsquo;20.</p>
