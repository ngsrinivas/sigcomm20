<p>The N2Women workshop aims to foster connections among the
under-represented women in computer networking and related research
fields. The 10th N2Women Workshop also welcomes <em>men</em> who share
the same research interests, attend the same conferences, and often
face the same career hurdles and obstacles to join us!</p>

<h3 id="mentoring-program">Mentoring Program</h3>
<p>N2Women&rsquo;20 will have a mentor/mentee program. We would like to extend mentoring throughout the week for the students who are attending SIGCOMM virtually. This year, we will create a few mentoring sessions with different focused questions.</p>

<p>You are also welcome to attend mentoring sessions organized by SIGCOMM&rsquo;20 throughout the SIGCOMM week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are looking for mentors who can host mentees with similar research interests during N2Womean and the main SIGCOMM conference and workshops. If you are a SIGCOMM regular attendee and a senior researcher, please consider volunteering as a mentor. If you are interested in helping out, please email N2Women&rsquo;20 workshop co-chairs or the mentor chair of SIGCOMM&rsquo;20.</p>

<h3 id="young-investigator-fellowship-award">Call for Fellowship
  Awards</h3>

<p>N2Women is pleased to announce the continuation of our N2Women Young
Researcher Fellowship awards. N2Women considers you a young researcher
if you are currently a student, working as a post-doc, or in the 1st
or 2nd year of your new research career. These awards will partially
cover a young researcher's conference cost (up to $1000) to a meeting
where an N2Women event will be held. In exchange, the young researcher
must help organize the N2Women meeting. The benefit of doing the
organization, in addition to the funds, is for the young researcher to
connect with the organizers of the conference who are, typically,
leaders in the research field. We will arrange for a faculty or
research member of N2Women to assist/mentor the young researcher in
this task.</p>
           
<p>Support for these N2Women Young Researcher Fellowship awards have been
generously provided by ACM SIGMOBILE, ACM SIGCOMM, IEEE Communications
Society, and IEEE Computer Society (CS) Technical Committee on
Computer Communications (TCCC).</p>
