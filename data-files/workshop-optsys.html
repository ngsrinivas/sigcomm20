          SIGCOMM 2020 Workshop on Optical Systems Design (OptSys 2020)</h1>

          <h3 id="call-for-papers">Call for Oral Presentations</h3>

          <p>Optical equipment is a fundamental component of modern
          systems. Today, nearly all wide-area, metro, and data center
          communications are carried over optical technology making
          optics a billion-dollar industry. Optics is poised to play
          an even bigger role in next-generation networks. The high
          bandwidth and ultra-low latency requirements of modern
          Cloud-centric systems, such as machine learning and business
          analytics, are hard to meet in a cost-effective manner with
          traditional electrical devices. </p>

<p>The OptSys workshop focuses on the design and implementation of
  optical networked systems for the next-generation Cloud
  infrastructure. These systems pose a number of research challenges
  spanning multiple research areas, e.g., physical layer, scheduling,
  synchronization, congestion control, orchestration, and topology
  reconfiguration, which require cross-layer and cross-disciplinary
  solutions. Solving these challenges requires the collaboration of
  cross-disciplinary teams and joint co-design across the stack. The
  workshop aims to bring together participants across the optics,
  networking, systems, and distributed algorithms community to jointly
  tackle these challenges and foster discussions and collaboration
  opportunities across these communities.</p>


<p>Following the successful experience from
  <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2019/workshop-optsys.html">last
  year’s edition,</a> the workshop will feature a combination of
  submitted talks and keynote speakers, selected among the community
  top academics and researchers, with an emphasis on encouraging
  engaging technical discussions amongst the participants. </p>

</ul>

<h3 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>Submissions include an extended abstract for oral presentation at
  the workshop. The abstract can include novel material as well as
  previously published work, since the focus of the workshop is to
  help disseminating ideas across communities and encourage lively and
  interactive discussions. If the work is based on previous work, this
  should be clearly indicated in the submission. Submissions can be a
  one-page extended abstract (excluding references) or an up to
  six-page paper, using the new ACM template (using sigconf document
  type) from the
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">2020
  ACM consolidated template package</a> or you can also use this
  <a href="https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template">LaTeX
  template.</a> The font size must be 9 points. The submission must
  include author’s names and affiliations for single-blind peer
  reviewing by the workshop committee. Use this link for submission:
  <a href="https://optsys20.hotcrp.com">https://optsys20.hotcrp.com.</a>
  The workshop will not have formal proceedings but we plan to publish
  accepted abstracts on this page.</p>


<h3 id="virtual-participation">Virtual participation</h3>

<p>In case of a global outbreak of COVID-19, we will investigate and
support the possibility of remote participation to protect the health
  and safety of SIGCOMM and OptSys participants.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>Attendance of the workshop is by open registration and subject to
  the same registration fees and rules as all the other SIGCOMM 2020
  workshops. The registrants of the workshop may freely attend any
  workshop on the same day.</p>
