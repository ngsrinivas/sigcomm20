<p>
Participants are invited to a half-day overview of the field of network
security.  This tutorial is distinguished by its emphasis on imposing
structure on the subject through attention to network architecture,
recurring patterns in security mechanisms, and the interactions of security
mechanisms with each other and with other aspects of network architecture.

<p>
We expect that this tutorial will be helpful to any networking
expert who is not well-versed in security.  In particular, we see two
kinds of people deriving special benefit from it:  researchers who are
interested in moving into security and want an overview suggestive of
new opportunities, and faculty members who teach networking and would
like to improve their presentation of network security.  This material
(both presented and online, see [tutorial]) could easily be converted
into 2-4 classroom lectures.

<h2 id="outline">Background</h2>

<p>
Everyone understands the importance of security in today's computing
landscape, and the central role played by networks in both enabling and
defending against security attacks.  Although cyber-security is an
extremely active area of research, there is relatively little ``framing''
of the subject, in the sense of classifying attacks and defenses, or
drawing boundaries between subareas.  To some extent this is
inevitable--security flaws are often gaps in the models through which we
understand complex systems--but it still impedes progress in both
research and practical adoption of research results.

<p>
The purpose of this tutorial is to organize and lay out the landscape
of network security.  Although it is a survey, it contains new content,
of three kinds:

<p>
<I>Classification and architecture:</I>
Our novel classification of security attacks, based on who are the
attackers, defenders, and potential victims, is pragmatic because it
correlates well with possible defense mechanisms.  Our architectural model
of networking [architecture] is realistic--therefore leaving fewer
vulnerable gaps--and facilitates the recognition of patterns.

<p>
<I>Patterns:</I>
We explain that, although mechanisms for network security are extremely
diverse, they are all instances of just a few patterns.  These patterns
recur at many levels of the network hierarchy, for example local-area
networks, wide-area networks, and distributed application systems.  By
emphasizing the patterns rather than the individual details, we are able
to cover more ground, and present a much larger design space of possible
solutions to security problems.

<p>
<I>Interactions:</I>
Security mechanisms interact in important ways, with each other and with
other aspects of networking.  To provide communication services that are
secure and also fully supportive of distributed applications, network
designers must understand the consequences of their decisions on all
aspects of network architecture and services.

<h2 id="background">Outline</h2>


<p>
1. What is network security?

<p>
1.1. A practical classification of network security attacks

<p>
Coarse-grained but meaningful, based on who are the attackers,
defenders, and victims.  With contemporary concerns about privacy,
sometimes the attacker is the network.
These categories correlate well with defense mechanisms.

<p>
1.2. Relation to other definitions of security

<p>
Includes the gaps where no good defenses exist.

<p>
2. A model of networking

<p>
This explains how we can decompose network architecture into
networks-as-modules, in a way that makes the pattern-based approach
feasible.

<p>
3. Cryptographic protocols

<p>
The first pattern and the primary user defense.  Can conceal packet
contents but not packet headers.

<p>
3.1. Trust and identity

<p>
3.2. Public-key cryptography and its uses

<p>
3.3. Three IP cryptographic protocols

<p>
A comparison of TLS, Quic, and IPsec ESP.

<p>
3.4. Interactions between cryptographic protocols
and other aspects of networking

<p>
Particularly layering, performance, and mobility.

<p>
4. Packet filtering

<p>
The second pattern and the primary network defense.

<p>
4.1. Content-based packet filtering

<p>
4.2. Path-based packet filtering

<p>
4.3. Interactions between packet filtering and other aspects of networking

<p>
Particularly routing, layering, cryptographic protocols.

<p>
5. Dynamic resource allocation

<p>
The third pattern, employed by both network infrastructure and users.
We include in this pattern dynamic reduction of the resources used per
request.

<p>
6. Compound sessions and overlays for security

<p>
Employed by users to conceal packet headers.
This fourth pattern is seldom recognized, although it is the basic for many
security mechanisms such as VPNs (compound sessions made by proxies)
and Tor (overlays).  The entire purpose of the pattern is to interact
with (thwart) packet filtering.

<p>
