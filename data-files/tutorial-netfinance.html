	    <p>Traditionally, the networking view of finance has been one of a
               speed race to enable low-latency trading. Using a variety of techniques, market
               traders have sought to minimize the tick-to-trade latency: the time duration
               between receiving an update to a price (tick) and buying or selling  an order
               based on this price (trade). These techniques include kernel bypass networking,
               FPGAs, low-latency NICs, layer 1 switching, and microwave links.
            </p>

            <p>
	       An alternative view of finance is from the perspective of an
               exchange operator---as opposed to a trader participating in the exchange. In
               addition to low latency, an exchange operator needs to ensure fair access to
               the exchange across different market traders, i.e., ensuring that all traders
               see the same traversal times into and out of the exchange.
            </p>

            <p>
               This fairness of market latencies contrasts with the traditional networking
               view of fairness, which deals with fair allocation of throughput instead of
               latency. In the context of trading exchanges, latency fairness has two aspects
               to it: on the inbound side when market participants' orders are transmitted to
               the matching engine and on the outbound side when market data are disseminated
               to traders. This means a trader's order cannot be overtaken by another trader's
               order. Thus, orders have to be processed in a globally FIFO manner even if they
               enter the exchange at different gateways. Further, no trader should receive
               market data before any other trader.
            </p>

            <p>
               Currently, exchanges meet these requirements
               using carefully-engineered, bespoke data networks, limiting their scale and
               scope. In this tutorial, we show that accurate clock synchronization deployed
               at scale can transform an unpredictable market into a nearly perfect FIFO
               machine, even if the market is built upon extremely jittery infrastructure such
               as the public cloud. This would not only allow exchanges to scale but it would
               also significantly reduce the cost of participation, thereby democratizing
               financial trading.

            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

            </p>Three trends make this tutorial particularly timely. First, the widespread availability of public cloud computing services reduces the capital expenses associated with running web services, making the cloud an attractive platform for deploying financial applications. At the same time, the data privacy concerns associated with the cloud are beginning to be addressed through the availability of solutions that offer
            more stringent data privacy guarantees.</p>

            <p>Second, while the availability of the public cloud has lowered the barrier to deploying new applications at scale, the variable nature of cloud infrastructure due to the heterogenous and unknown nature of cloud hardware causes significant latency variability---a detriment to deploying electronic trading exchanges in the cloud. Addressing this latency variability requires highly accurate clock synchronization algorithms that can be deployed in software by cloud customers without requiring new hardware. The development of a recent software time synchronization algorithm (Huygens, NSDI 2018) allows us to revisit the possibility of using the public cloud for electronic trading exchanges. </p>

            <p>Third, the rise of programmable network interface cards (or SmartNICs) provides us a natural location on the edge of the network to deploy time synchronization algorithms and to hold orders and market data before they are ready for execution and dissemination respectively.</p>

                                Anirudh Sivaraman is an assistant professor at NYU's Computer Science Department.
                                His recent research has focused on enabling and taking
                                advantage of programmability within computer networks. He has also
                                been actively involved in the design and evolution of the P4 language
                                for programmable network devices. His past research includes work on
                                congestion control, network emulation, and network measurement. He
                                received the MIT EECS department's Frederick C. Hennie III Teaching
                                Award in 2012 and the ACM SIGCOMM Doctoral Dissertation Award in 2018.
                                He shared the IETF/IRTF's Applied Networking Research Prize in 2014
                                and the ACM SIGCOMM Best Paper Award in 2017.
