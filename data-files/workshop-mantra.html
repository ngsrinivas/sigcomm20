          SIGCOMM 2020 Workshop on Traffic Manipulation (ManTra 2020)</h1>

        <b style="color: red">ManTra 2020 is currently planned to be held on
        August 14 2020 in New York. The current submission deadline is set to
        1 May, but the time schedule may change depending on the
        situation. We are monitoring the developments with COVID-19 situation
        and will keep the website up to date with any changes that may be
        needed. The proceedings will be published in ACM series even if the
        workshop will be postponed or held virtually.<br/>
        The ManTra team is wishing everyone to stay healthy.</b>

        <p>Network attacks using traffic manipulation can have profound societal consequences. These attacks are
          increasing in frequency, sophistication, and stealthiness. Motivations behind these attacks vary from
          financial, political, terrorism, and more. These attacks can be performed by off-path or by on-path
          (Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)) attackers or by malicious operators. Traffic manipulations include attacks
          injecting malicious packets into the communication stream (e.g., injecting malicious scripts into TCP
          connections), manipulating time over NTP, attacking the IP layer by exploiting IP fragmentation for DNS cache
          poisoning, as well as redirecting communication, e.g., via BGP prefix hijacks. Traffic manipulation attacks
          aim to cause various types of denial of service, theft of crypto-currency, distribution of malware, disruption
          of governmental or financial organisations, censorship or surveillance.</p>

        <p>The ManTra workshop provides a forum for researchers, practitioners, network operators, and the Internet
          standards community to present and discuss the state of the art in traffic manipulation attacks and
          countermeasures. The workshop considers different types of attackers, from very strong ones such as the
          corrupt operators and MitM adversaries to weak off-path attackers and different type of attacks, all that
          utilise manipulation of traffic for achieving the attack goal, as well as the defences against them. The
          attacks can be sophisticated, utilising corruption of multiple building blocks in concert, or simple, against
          one specific system or protocol.</p>

        <p>The goal of the ManTra workshop is to provide a venue that focuses exclusively on traffic manipulation
          attacks in the Internet and countermeasures against them, presenting a broad view of technologies and
          approaches for manipulating traffic (from injections into the communication stream to hijacking
          communication), evaluations and simulations thereof, identification of new techniques and vulnerabilities,
          bringing together researchers and practitioners in all areas of computer, networks and systems security for
          studying the problems and paving the ways towards deployment of defences. Works which identify new
          vulnerabilities allowing traffic manipulation attacks, works which evaluate attacks in the wild, or works that
          perform measurements to understand the scope or extent of the attacks as well as techniques used to launch
          them in the wild are all welcome.</p>
