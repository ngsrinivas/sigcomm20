  <h3 id="policy-against-discrimination-harassment">Policy Against
    Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
  
<p>Discrimination and harassment are not to be tolerated within our
  community. All SIGCOMM events, either conventional, hybrid or
  virtually held, and communications (emails, online social network
  groups, etc.) must abide by ACM policies,
  including <a href='https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment'>the
  policy against discrimination and harassment.</a> If a violation of
  this policy occurs, ACM urges reporting the incident to the event
  chairs or the ACM President, CEO, or COO. SIGCOMM recognizes that
  reporting to the conference chairs or an upper-level ACM
  administrator can be intimidating, especially in the face of an
  already traumatic experience.</p>
  
<p>The SIGCOMM CARES Committee (SIGCOMM Committee to Aid REporting on
  discrimination and haraSsment policy violations) is intended to
  assist members of our community who may have experienced or
  witnessed behaviors that violate the ACM policy against
  discrimination and harassment at an event sponsored by the SIG,
  which includes conferences held virtually such as SIGCOMM'20. Note
  that although CARES can assist with submitting or even submit a
  report of a violation on behalf of someone else, the individual
  initiating the report eventually needs to personally confirm to ACM
  the facts as reported in the report (a CARES committee member may,
  under exceptional circumstances, report an incident on behalf of a
  SIG member, but the member remains responsible for corroborating the
  facts with ACM). </p>

<p>CARES committee members can help by providing advice on how to
  approach such a situation and ensure it is investigated by ACM. They
  are available to listen and help anyone who has either experienced
  or witnessed discrimination and harassment at an event promoted by
  the SIG, or needs counseling on how to handle it. </p>

<p>In addition, CARES committee members can assist SIG members who
  feel they may have been subjected to discrimination that occurs
  during ACM's publications-related processes, not just at ACM events.
  Those includes violations of ACMâ€™s policies
  on <a href='https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview'>plagiarism,
  misrepresentation, and falsification,</a> as well
  as <a href='https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/coercion-and-abuse'>coercion
  and abuse in the ACM publications process,</a>
  and <a href='https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities'>roles
  and responsibilities in ACM publishing.</a>  CARES committee members
  can also help by providing advice on how to approach such situations
  and ensure they are investigated by ACM.</p>

<p>The CARES members participating in SIGCOMM'20 can be contacted
  online, via email or directly on Slack. The committee members are,
  in alphabetical order, Sujata Banerjee (sujata.banerjee [at]
  acm.org), Marinho Barcellos (marinho.barcellos [at] waikato.ac.nz),
  Craig Partridge (craig.partridge [at] colostate.edu), Jennifer
  Rexford (jrex [at] cs.princeton.edu), Justine Sherry (sherry [at]
  cs.cmu.edu), and Ellen Zegura (ewz [at] cc.gatech.edu).</p>

<h3 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy (from ACM)</h3>

<p>The link here contains the ACM Privacy Policy, which applies to
  SIGCOMM, its members and all the conferences SIGCOMM sponsors, and
  its details are available here. ACM, SIGCOMM and conference
  organizers are committed to protecting the privacy of all conference
  attendees, members and not members. The Policy explains how ACM and
  SIGCOMM use and maintain the privacy of personal information
  collected online in connection with the conference.</p>
