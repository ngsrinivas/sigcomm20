            "abstract" : "As the traffic in DC networks steady growth, the electrical switching based data center networks (DCNs) have intrinsic bandwidth bottleneck and require power consuming multi-tier switching layers. Optical nanoseconds switched DCN systems could provide very large bandwidth and high-efficient cost and power performance. However, the deployment of nanoseconds optical switches in DCNs remains a challenge due to the lack of nanoseconds switch control, optical buffers for packet contention resolution, and the need of high-cost burst clock and data recovery. In this work we present a nanosecond switch control and clock-distribution technique that is experimentally demonstrated and deployed to enable a nanoseconds optical switched DCN with packet contention resolution and no burst mode receiver. Results confirm that the nanoseconds switch control and clock-distribution technique provide few tens of otical switching reconfiguration time, data and clock recovery within a few ns with stable operation and low packet loss.",

            "abstract" : "Emerging optical communication topologies enable demand-aware networks: networks whose physical topology is optimized towards the demand, either statically or dynamically. But how useful are demand-aware networks? As usual in computer science, the answer is: it depends! In this talk, we explore metrics for quantifying the temporal and non-temporal structure of traffic patterns, and show analytically how these metrics relate to 'what can be achieved' by a demand-aware network. In particular, we propose an information-theoretic approach and highlight an intriguing connection between demand-aware networks and coding and self-adjusting data structures. We discuss both offline and online algorithms to design demand-aware networks, and as a case study, show how to design demand-aware networks whose route lengths are proportional to the entropy of the traffic pattern; this is asymptotically optimal.
