          <h1 id="call-for-papers">Call for Posters, Demos, and
          Student Research Competition</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SIGCOMM poster/demo session showcases works-in-progress in an informal setting. Topics of interest are the same as research topics in the SIGCOMM conference call for papers. We strongly encourage student and industry submissions. The SIGCOMM 2020 poster/demo committee will review all posters and demo proposals. Students must (virtually) present student posters at the conference. Authors of accepted papers in SIGCOMM 2020 may not submit in this track on the same work as in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the main conference, this year's Poster/Demo session will also take place online. The authors of accepted posters/demos will be required to present their work online during the poster/demo session.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should you submit a Poster or a Demo?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference. Accepted posters and demos will be published as a two-page abstract for the archived conference proceedings. In addition, the top few submissions may be forwarded for publication to the SIGCOMM newsletter, the Computer Communication Review (CCR). <b>The SIGCOMM poster and demo sessions will also serve as an </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>ACM SIGCOMM Student Research Competition</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Poster?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect both poster and demo presenters to prepare a poster. A poster is A0 paper size in portrait mode (841 &times; 1189mm), to which you can affix visually appealing material that describes your research. Alternatively, you can use the space as a continuum. You should prepare the best material (visually appealing and succinct) that effectively communicates your research problem, techniques, results, and what is novel/important about the work. You need to submit an abstract describing in text what the poster would present. The abstract should clearly state: (a) the problem being addressed, (b) what makes this problem interesting, important, and difficult, (c) your approach to the problem, and (d) the key contribution. The authors of </span><strong>accepted </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">posters/demos will also be expected to submit a poster in A0 paper size in portrait mode as well.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What To Submit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are submitting a poster or a demo, you must submit a two-page abstract in PDF format that describes your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All submissions must obey the following formatting requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Submit abstracts of no more than two single&ndash;spaced pages, including references, figures, tables, etc.; for demos, an additional third page is required solely for describing the technical requirements. Abstracts whose content is longer than the page limit will not be reviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Submit abstracts formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5&rdquo; by 11&rdquo;) paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25&rdquo; by 3.33&rdquo;, 0.33&rdquo; space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission satisfies the above requirements. If you are using LaTeX, you can make use of </span><a href="https://github.com/scyue/ccp-sigcomm18"><strong>this template for ACM conference proceedings</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike the official template, it only includes examples for conference proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is highly encouraged that each demo proposal includes a video clip showcasing the work, in addition to the abstract. The video should be no more than 3 minutes and should give a good idea of what the demo is about and what it would look like. Including a video clip will help the committee better understand and evaluate your proposal. Poster submissions may also include a video clip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abstracts and videos of accepted posters and demos will be made available to all attendees at the conference.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors of accepted demos and posters will be encouraged to publish auxiliary material in the ACM Digital Library with their poster/demo (source code, packet traces, and so forth) to improve the reproducibility of their results. The auxiliary material does not need to be submitted but can be referenced in the submission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The posters and demos submitted to SIGCOMM 2020 must be original and cannot be concurrently submitted to other workshops or conferences during the SIGCOMM poster/demo review period. Dual submissions are a waste of the reviewer's time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where To Submit</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please submit your abstract at </span><a href="https://sigcomm20posters.hotcrp.com/"><strong>https://sigcomm20posters.hotcrp.com/</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Submissions are single blind, so please include authors&rsquo; names and affiliation. When submitting (a poster or demo), indicate if the submission should be considered for the SRC.</span></p>
