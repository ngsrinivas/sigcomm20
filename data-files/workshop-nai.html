  SIGCOMM 2020 Workshop on Network Application Integration
  (NAI 2020)</h1>

  <h3 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h3>

<p>The Internet was designed and launched more than 50 years ago to
satisfy yet unforeseen applications. The Internet's adaptation and
scalability have been proved remarkably successful over the
years. Today, more than 4 billion users (half of the global
population) and 20 billion devices are online â€” the exponential growth
of the connected people and devices are expected to continue over the
next years.</p>

<p>However, the general-purpose and best-effort model of the Internet
is challenged due to the ever-growing demand for more complex
applications with stricter application-specific requirements. How can
we deliver 4k videos to everybody (including the rest 4 billion
people)? How can we ensure ultra low latency for applications such as
self-driving cars and cloud gaming? How do we support high-bandwidth,
low latency applications such as AR, VR, and holographic
communications? How can we guarantee 100% service availability? How
can we enable innovation at the edges for the next wave of 5G and IoT
applications?</p>

<p>Network-Application Integration (NAI) can push the boundaries of
what can be achieved. The maturing of NAI protocols such as the ALTO
protocol, the recent report of large-scale, real implementation and
realized benefits of NAI systems such as the Flow Director system, and
the recent emergence of new, flexible networking mechanisms such as
APN6, PANRG, P4, NPL, INT, and SmartNIC, all make NAI an exciting
field for exploration by the core networking community.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we search for contributions to the design
principles and real implementations of systems that enable
network-application co-design. We will focus on realistic NAI designs,
implementations and experiences, and explore both sides of NAI:
application-aware networking (AAN) and network-aware application
(NAA). Keynotes and a panel will be included to complement more
traditional paper sessions, to set the research agenda, debate the
issues, and share the most recent progress.</p>
