            "abstract" : "GPUs have emerged as a popular choice for deep learning. To deal with ever-growing datasets, it is also common to use multiple GPUs in parallel for distributed deep learning. Although achieving cost-effectiveness in these clusters relies on efficient sharing, modern GPU hardware, deep learning frameworks, and cluster managers are not designed for efficient, fine-grained sharing of GPU resources. In this talk, I will present our recent works on efficient GPU resource management, both within a single GPU and across many GPUs in a cluster.<br/>I will start at the macroscale and present Tiresias first, which is a GPU cluster manager to reduce the average job completion times of training jobs that schedules jobs in an information-constrained scenario and assigns jobs to GPUs based on their model characteristics. It introduces two novel schedulers: one that relies on partial information and one that is information-agnostic, that allow Tiresias to perform similar to that of schedulers with perfect knowledge. Next, we will focus on the micro scale and present Salus, which enables fine-grained sharing of individual GPUs. It is an execution service that enforces fine-grained sharing via two primitives: fast job switching and memory sharing. I will show how these primitives can be used to implement diverse GPU sharing policies. Salus improves the utilization of an individual GPU by 2X to 3X for hyper-parameter tuning and training; for inference applications, it improves by 7X over NVIDIA MPS with small performance overhead. <br/>Both Tiresias and Salus are open-source and available at <a href='https://github.com/symbioticlab'>https://github.com/symbioticlab.</a>",

I will show the design of a scalable video data management system and demonstrate a few use cases to highlight the efficacy of such a system. On efficiency, I will describe the need for increasing stream and analytics density and how HW/SW co-design and acceleration can be applied to make this happen. On automation, I will describe the need for tools to automate the E2E workflow for video analytics at the edge and show examples ranging from addressing labeling challenges to automating model optimization on target edge platforms.

While computer vision models have become more accurate and capable, they are also becoming resource-hungry and expensive for 24/7 analysis of video. As a result, live video analytics across multiple cameras also means a large computational footprint on premises built with a good amount of expensive edge compute hardware (CPU, GPU etc.). <br/>Total cost of ownership (TCO) for video analytics is an important consideration and pain point for our customers. With that in mind, we integrated Live Video Analytics from Azure Media Services and Microsoft Rocket (from Microsoft Research) to enable an order-of-magnitude improvement in throughput per edge core (frame per second analyzed per CPU/GPU core), while maintaining the accuracy of the video analytics insights.",
