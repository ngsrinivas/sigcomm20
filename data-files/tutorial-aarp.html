            <p>This tutorial features an algebraic theory of routing as a unified framework to reason about routing protocols. The theory establishes nexuses between routing metrics and routing policies, on the one hand, and protocol behaviors, on the other. It informs the design and configuration of routing protocols and explains away undesirable or otherwise counter-intuitive behaviors that these protocols sometimes exhibit, such as non-termination, non-optimality, forwarding loops, and traffic black holes. Recently, the theory found uses in the verification of routing configurations and in the design of routing protocols for programmable control and data planes.</p>

            <p>The tutorial covers the main principles, results, algorithms, and subtleties of the algebraic theory of routing, illustrated with examples from current routing protocols, and projects the theory into a future for this type of protocols.</p>

            <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

            <p>Algebraic theory of routing is an expression given to a framework of an algebraic nature to reason about routing algorithms and protocols from first principles. The theory emerges from the key observation that at a certain level of abstraction routing protocols can be described in common terms: they all perform iterations of selection and extension operations on attributes at the nodes of a network. Attributes represent metrics and parameters that are relevant in a given routing context; a selection operation retains one attribute from a pair of attributes and discards the other; and an extension operation transforms the attribute of a path into that of another path containing more links. At this level of abstraction, routing protocols differ on how selection and extension operations on attributes are distributed among the nodes and interleaved at a node. The fundamental insight obtained from the theory is that the global behaviors exhibited by a given class of routing protocols is determined by the algebraic properties of the selection operation, of the extension operation, and of the entwinement between these two operations, as they are performed locally at every node.</p>


            <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

            <p>The tutorial is organized in six parts as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Why a theory for routing protocols (15 minutes): </strong>The necessity of a solid framework to reason about routing protocols is motivated with the presentation of undesirable and counter-intuitive behaviors exhibited by current routing protocols: BGP and the possibility of non-termination; EIGRP and non-optimal paths; administrative distances and forwarding loops; Babel and traffic black holes. At the same time, the possibility of a unified treatment for routing protocols is argued from the fact that they all perform iterations of common elementary operations.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Routing algebra and optimality (60 minutes): </strong>The concept of routing algebra is presented as a set of attributes, a binary selection operation on attributes and a binary extension operation on attributes, together with a basic set of algebraic properties for these operations. The selection operation is equivalently described by a total order on attributes. Multiple examples of routing algebras are given representing various performance metrics both in wired and wireless networks. We show that non-restarting vectoring protocols, such as BGP and EIGRP, do not solve the problem of optimal path routing, in general. Instead, they solve the problem of optimal path routing constrained to a destination-based forwarding strategy. If the routing algebra satisfies the algebraic property of left-isotonicity, then non-restarting vectoring protocols do solve the problem of (unconstrained) optimal path routing. We further show that, contrarily to a non-restarting vectoring protocol, a restarting vectoring protocol, such as Babel, requires left-isotonicity for correct delivery of data-packets and a link-state protocol, such as OSPF, requires both left- and right-isotonicity for correct delivery of data-packets, in which case both these classes of protocols route on optimal paths.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Relaxation of algebraic properties (15 minutes): </strong>Some of the properties that were assumed in the definition of a routing algebra are not satisfied in relevant routing contexts. We show that the Multi-Exit-Discriminator (MED) parameter of BGP may lead to a violation of the associativity of the selection operation; that the routing loop detection capability of BGP violates the associativity of the extension operation; and that the configuration of administrative distances may break inflation (also called monotonicity), which is an algebraic property entwining the total order and the extension operation on attributes. The last two cases prompt the generalization of a routing algebra presented next.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Routing algebra with maps and protocol termination (60 minutes): </strong>For vectoring protocols, the concept of routing algebra is generalized by modeling extension operations with maps on attributes rather than with a binary extension operation on them. Furthermore, contrarily to a routing algebra, the maps on attributes are not assumed to be inflationary. The concept of routing algebra with maps leads, in particular, to an algebraic model for BGP. The problem of non-termination of vectoring protocols is illustrated with realistic inter-domain routing policies. Strict virtuousness is presented as the algebraic property on network cycles that is both sufficient and necessary for termination of vectoring protocols. We show that inter-domain routing policies can be formulated using concepts from game theory, with BGP solving the problem of finding the Nash equilibria of a suitably defined game.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Routing algebra with sets and multiple optimality criteria (20 minutes): </strong>The problem mentioned earlier of vectoring protocols routing non-optimally in the absence of the algebraic property of isotonicity can be solved by subsuming the total order on attributes under a partial order on them that satisfies isotonicity. The broader problem of routing simultaneously on a multiplicity of optimality criteria is also solvable with a partial order on attributes that, besides satisfying isotonicity, is contained in the total orders associated with the various criteria. The concept of routing algebra is generalized to partial orders, with a selection operation on sets of attributes rather than on (single) attributes. Vectoring protocols, both non-restarting and restarting, are presented that compute according to a selection operation on sets of attributes, electing and advertising multiple attributes per destination.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Conclusions and bibliography (10 minutes): </strong>Main conclusions are presented and a guided tour of the bibliography is provided.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="audience-expectations-and-prerequisites">Audience Expectations and Prerequisites</h2>

            <p>The tutorial will enrich researchers, practitioners, and educators in computer networking, even if not experts on routing. The only prerequisites are knowledge of routing protocols at the level of an undergraduate course in computer networks and a predisposition to deductive reasoning. The algebraic constructs themselves are simple, if unusual outside a routing frame of reference.</p>
