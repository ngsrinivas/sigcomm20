  <h1 id="">ACM SIGCOMM 2020 Workshop on Secure Programmable Network
    Infrastructure (SPIN 2020)</h1>

  <h3 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h3>


<p> The 1st SPIN workshop aims to provide a forum for the community to come together and rethink fundamental questions in Internet security. 
The Internet was not designed with a secure foundation. However, as more and more applications rely on secure network services, 
the importance of network security has grown significantly. Looking forward, the security of networks and distributed systems will become a first-class design goal, 
just like performance, reliability, etc. are today. In the past, however, one hindrance in designing secure networks is that the Internet was very hard to change. 
Networking devices used to be "blackboxes", and only a handful of switch vendors decide what goes into these boxes. Despite many interesting proposals on 
Internet/network security, many of these useful designs cannot be easily integrated into the operational network without a forklift change. </p>


<p> Recently, a new opportunity is on the horizon---networking hardware is becoming programmable. The networking community has already leveraged this to design a 
range of new systems and in-network capabilities. Unfortunately, most existing developments are not related to security. 
In this workshop, we are soliciting papers that focus on examining 
the security implications of the trend of network programmability, particularly in the recent development of programmable data planes. We seek contributions on early ideas 
in these areas, position papers that outline next steps in network security, as well as preliminary papers from ongoing projects that could benefit from early community feedback. 
The workshop seeks to bring together experts in networking, security, hardware, programming languages, and systems, with the goal of 
identifying exciting opportunities for network security in the next generation. </p>

<h3 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h3>
<p>Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at another conference or journal. 
LaTeX sources can be found at <a href="https://github.com/scyue/latex-sigcomm18">this link</a>. 
With older versions of this template, authors should use "10pt" in the documentclass command to ensure that 
the font size for all submitted papers is 10 points. The length of the submitted paper should be 6 pages, excluding references. 
Paper submissions should not include author names or affiliations, and submissions will go through a double-blind reviewing process by the program committee. 
At least one author for each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the workshop in person. We expect that at least some papers at SPIN would represent "work-in-progress" 
projects. Therefore, authors of published papers could choose to extend their work to full-length conference papers later. </p>


<p><strong>Paper Submission:</strong></p>

<p>Please submit your paper via <a href="https://spin20.hotcrp.com/">https://spin20.hotcrp.com/</a>.</p>
